# Matboard Bridge Project
## Project Overview
Designed and constructed a small-scale box girder bridge using matboard, engineered to withstand increasing train loads until structural failure. The objective was to maximize the bridge's failure load while maintaining efficient use of materials.

## Features
- Conducted **failure load verification** by calculating factors of safety for various failure modes.
- Generated **shear force and bending moment diagrams** to visualize the expected failure forces and moments.
- Analyzed performance using both theoretical calculations and experimental data to assess structural behavior under load.
